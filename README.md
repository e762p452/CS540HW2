# CS540HW2
This program uses a class called process that has pid and lottery as ints. 
It also has a class called Scheduler that manages the lottery algorithm. It allocates tickets and selects which process to run next. After all of the tickets are allocated then a random number generator is used to simulate the lottery selection. Once the code has been run a random process will have "won" the lottery and the process that won will be shown on the output.
